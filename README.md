# Predicting-grades-using-Machine-Learning-models-w-report

This project was from my Data Science Statistics class (Fall '21). The data provided in this project approaches student achievement in secondary education
of two Portuguese schools. The variables include student grades, demographic, social and school related features and the data was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. A dictionary of the variables is given in the last page. Two datasets were provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). The goal was to develop predictive models for the final year grade (G3) using statistical learning methods. Enjoy!
